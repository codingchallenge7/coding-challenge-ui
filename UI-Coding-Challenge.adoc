= FX Rate UI Coding Challenge

Welcome to the FX Rate UI coding challenge!

This project is designed to assess your React, JavaScript, and CSS skills.
**You do NOT need to make any changes to the backend Java code.**
Your focus should be on the React UI and CSS only.

== Challenge Overview

You are provided with a working React application that interacts with a backend FX Rate REST API.
Your task is to complete the UI by addressing the `TODO` comments in the React (`App.js`) and CSS (`App.css`) files.

NOTE: The backend is already implemented and running. You do not need to change or review any Java code.

== What You Need To Do

- Open `/src/App.js` and `/src/App.css`.
- Complete all `TODO` tasks in these files.
- You may refactor, improve, or restyle the UI as you see fit, but **do not** change backend endpoints or logic.
- You are encouraged to demonstrate best practices in React, JavaScript, and CSS.

== Example TODOs (You will see these in the code)

- Show a loading spinner or message when data is loading.
- Display the latest FX rate in a more readable format (e.g., with 4 decimal places).
- Create a table or list to display the last ten historic rates (see the "Get Historic rates" button and section).
- Improve the overall look and feel of the UI.
- Display the FX exchange status somewhere on the page.

== Evaluation Criteria

- Code readability and maintainability.
- Use of idiomatic React and JavaScript.
- CSS clarity, structure, and responsiveness.
- User experience and UI polish.
- Correctness and completeness of all TODOs.

== How To Run

1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2. Run `npm install` in the project root.
3. Start the backend Spring Boot server (already implemented for you, or use the provided `build-and-run.sh` script).
4. Run `npm start` to launch the React UI.
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

[NOTE]
====
You can use the provided `build-and-run.sh` script to build and run both the backend and frontend automatically.
This script is fully runnable by itself: simply execute

 chmod +x build-and-run.sh
 ./build-and-run.sh

It will check for required tools, build and start the backend, install frontend dependencies, and start the React UI.
No manual steps are needed beyond running this script.
====

== Submission Guidelines
- This coding challenge will be discussed in the next interview round where you will be asked to explain your code and design choices.
- Ensure you visualize future improvements or features you would add.

== Notes

- The backend provides endpoints for latest rates, historic rates, and FX exchange status.
- The "Get Historic rates" button fetches the latest 10 rates across all pairs and should display them in a user-friendly way.
- All backend endpoints are already implemented and available.

== Good luck!
