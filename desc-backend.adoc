= FX Rate Service Backend

== Overview

This project implements a Spring Boot REST backend service for FX rates. It provides endpoints to submit, retrieve, and manage FX rates for currency pairs, with the following features:

- Store the last ten FX rates per currency pair.
- Generate random rates for EURUSD and GBPUSD.
- Provide endpoints to get, add, delete, and list rates and pairs.
- CORS policy enabled for all origins.
- The `/api/fxrate/latest` endpoint generates and returns a random rate for the requested pair, but every 5th call returns a random EURUSD rate.

== Key Changes

=== pom.xml

- Added Spring Boot dependencies and build plugin for Maven.

=== Model

- `FxRate.java`: Represents an FX rate with base/quote currency, rate, and event time.

=== Service

- `FxRateService.java`:
  - Stores last ten rates per currency pair.
  - Generates random rates for requested pairs.
  - Every 5th call to `getLatestRate` returns a random EURUSD rate.
  - Methods to add, retrieve, delete, and list rates and pairs.

=== Controller

- `FxRateController.java`:
  - Endpoints to add, get, and delete rates.
  - Endpoint to list all pairs.
  - Endpoint to generate random rates for EURUSD and GBPUSD.
  - Endpoint to get the latest rate (with random generation logic).

=== CORS

- `WebConfig.java`: Configures CORS to allow all origins, methods, and headers.

=== Application Entry

- `FxRateApplication.java`: Standard Spring Boot application entry point.

== API Endpoints

- `POST /api/fxrate` — Add a new FX rate.
- `GET /api/fxrate` — Get last ten rates for a currency pair.
- `GET /api/fxrate/pairs` — List all currency pairs with stored rates.
- `DELETE /api/fxrate` — Delete all rates for a currency pair.
- `DELETE /api/fxrate/all` — Delete all rates.
- `GET /api/fxrate/latest` — Get the latest (random) FX rate for a pair; every 5th call returns EURUSD.
- `POST /api/fxrate/generate-random` — Generate and store random rates for EURUSD and GBPUSD.

== Special Logic

- The service always stores only the last ten rates per pair.
- The `/api/fxrate/latest` endpoint generates a new random rate for the requested pair and stores it. Every 5th call (across all pairs) returns a new EURUSD rate instead.

== CORS

- All endpoints are accessible from any origin due to the global CORS configuration.
